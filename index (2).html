        Dialga
    </div>

    <div class="content-container">
        <div id="history-section" class="content-box">
            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>Dialga is a legendary Pokémon deeply rooted in the mythological fabric of the Sinnoh region, created by the primordial Pokémon Arceus to govern the fundamental aspect of time itself. In the ancient legends, Dialga emerged alongside Palkia, its counterpart responsible for space, as one of the cosmic guardians that maintain the delicate balance of existence. The mythology suggests that Dialga's very heartbeat regulates the flow of time, with each pulse potentially causing temporal shifts or manipulations.</p>
            <p>Throughout Pokémon lore, Dialga has been portrayed as a mystical and powerful entity, often central to epic narratives involving time travel, dimensional conflicts, and the preservation of cosmic order. Its origins are shrouded in mystery, with some ancient texts suggesting that Dialga existed before the current understanding of linear time, capable of moving through temporal dimensions with unparalleled ease and control.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="abilities-section" class="content-box">
            <h2>Abilities</h2>
            <p>Dialga possesses an extraordinary array of abilities that set it apart from ordinary Pokémon, most notably its signature ability to manipulate time itself. Its primary ability, Pressure, creates an intense psychic field that causes opponents to expend significantly more energy when executing their moves, effectively draining their stamina and strategic options. This ability reflects Dialga's overwhelming presence and its dominion over temporal energies.</p>
            <p>In various game iterations, Dialga has demonstrated unique time-related capabilities that transcend traditional battle mechanics. These include potential moves like Roar of Time, a devastating attack that temporarily disrupts the immediate temporal surrounding, causing massive damage while momentarily freezing the fabric of time. Some legendary researchers suggest that Dialga's abilities extend beyond mere battling, potentially allowing it to create localized time bubbles, reverse aging processes, or even glimpse potential future outcomes.</p>

        <div id="biology-section" class="content-box">
            <h2>Biology</h2>
            <div class="image-placeholder">
                <img src="images/biology.png" alt="Dialga Biology">
            </div>
            <p>Biologically, Dialga represents a fascinating convergence of Steel and Dragon-type characteristics, embodying both mechanical precision and mythical organic complexity. Its body structure resembles a quadrupedal dinosaur-like creature, covered in metallic blue and silver armor that seems to pulse with temporal energy. Distinctive diamond-like crystals protrude from its body, acting as temporal conduits that help regulate and focus its time-manipulation abilities.</p>
            <p>The creature's physiological makeup suggests an intricate blend of organic matter and temporal energy, with its internal systems seemingly operating outside conventional biological constraints. Its metabolism may not follow standard metabolic processes, instead drawing energy directly from temporal fluctuations. The crystalline structures on its body are theorized to be living temporal sensors, constantly monitoring and potentially redirecting time streams around its immediate environment.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="forms-section" class="content-box">
            <h2>Forms</h2>
            <div class="image-placeholder">
                <img src="images/forms.png" alt="Dialga Forms">
            </div>
            <p>Dialga exhibits remarkable transformative capabilities, with several documented forms that showcase its incredible adaptability and power. The most prominent among these is its Primal Form, a state of enhanced temporal manipulation where its body becomes suffused with pure chronological energy. In this form, Dialga's already impressive abilities are amplified exponentially, creating localized time distortions that can dramatically alter the immediate spatial environment.</p>
            <p>Alternative regional variants and theoretical forms have been documented by Pokémon researchers, suggesting that Dialga's potential for transformation might be even more extensive than currently understood. Some hypothetical forms include a potential Mega Evolution that would further concentrate its time-manipulation abilities, or a speculative Gigantamax form that could theoretically create massive temporal disruptions across significant geographical areas.</p>

        <div id="manga-section" class="content-box">
            <h2>Manga Appearances</h2>

                <img src="images/manga.png" alt="Dialga in Manga">
            </div>
            <p>In the expansive world of Pokémon manga, Dialga has been portrayed as a complex and pivotal character, far beyond a mere legendary creature. Various manga series have explored its deep mythological significance, often presenting Dialga as a sentient being with profound understanding of cosmic mechanics. In some storylines, it appears as a guardian of temporal integrity, intervening in critical moments to prevent catastrophic timeline alterations.</p>
            <p>Different manga adaptations have offered unique interpretations of Dialga's character and motivations. Some portray it as a somewhat aloof but ultimately benevolent entity, while others depict a more enigmatic and potentially dangerous being whose actions, though seemingly incomprehensible, are ultimately aimed at maintaining the delicate balance of time. These narrative explorations have significantly contributed to the rich mythology surrounding this legendary Pokémon.</p>

            </div>
            <p>The Pokémon anime has featured Dialga in several memorable and cinematically spectacular appearances, typically positioning it as a central figure in movies and special episodes exploring the deeper mythological aspects of the Pokémon universe. These appearances often emphasize Dialga's role as a cosmic guardian, showcasing its immense power and the profound responsibility of managing temporal flows. Several movies have centered entire plots around Dialga's interventions in critical temporal junctures.</p>
            <p>Notable anime appearances include storylines where Dialga collaborates with or confronts other legendary Pokémon, particularly its spatial counterpart Palkia. These narratives frequently explore themes of cosmic balance, the interconnectedness of different dimensional realities, and the potential consequences of disrupting fundamental natural laws. The anime has been instrumental in humanizing Dialga, presenting it not just as a powerful creature, but as an intelligent and complex being with its own agency and motivations.</p>
